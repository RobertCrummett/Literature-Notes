# Earthquake and Volcano Deformation

This repo contains the functions I created while reading through Paul Segall's magnificent textbook, "Earthquake and Volcano Deformation".
My main goal was to recreate as many figures as I could in color.

As of December 2022, this remains a work in progress. I am busy studying electromagnetic geophysical techniques for work.
