% The p-value diifers slightly from the one usually used with the bootstrap
% hypothesis test. The sample p-value is 0.9006 and is clearly upward
% biased, although the correction does not change the outcome of the
% hypothesis test as we will see.

    [~, ~, ks1] = kstest(draw, cdf);
    sps(i) = ks1;
end

pval = 2*min(sum(sps >= ksstat) + 1, sum(sps < ksstat) + 1)/(b + 1);

% Clearly the sample p-value was much larger than the p-value obtained by
% the K-S bootstrapping. The conclusion is unchanged however.
