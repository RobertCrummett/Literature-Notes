sgtitle 'Bootstrapping Method for Interquartile Range'

% As the number of replicates increases, multiple peaks in the distribution
% are resolved. This occurs because order statistics are concentrated on
% the sample values that are discrete unless the data set is very large.

% Thus, as the number of replicates rises, the bootstrapping method becomes
% more discrete, and the naive nonparametric bootstrapping approach fails.
