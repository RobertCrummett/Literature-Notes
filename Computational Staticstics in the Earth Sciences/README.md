# Computational Statistics In  The Earth Sciences
## Description
This file contains my notes, worked examples, and functions I used while
studying "Computational Statistics in the Earth Sciences" by Dr. Alan D.
Chave.
-----------------------------------------------
Almost all of the work is copied directly from the text.

Exception: Barlett's M test for homogeneity of variance is incorrect in
the text. I wrote a script that computes the exact Barlett statistic
with the help of a Google search.
