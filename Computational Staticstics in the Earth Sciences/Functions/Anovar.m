function [a] = Anovar(y, x, w)
% Computes the ANOVA table for a regression problem.
%
% Variables:
% y - response variable
% x - predictor variable
% w -- vector of weights lying between 0 and 1
% one - set to zero or one as x does not/does contain a collumn of ones
%
% Null hypothesis: Beta = 0
% When the null hypothesis is true, the elements of b should be distributed
% according to F(p-1,n-p).
% The test is quite blunt because one is usually interested in testing a
% certain paramter. This effectively tests the applicablility of regression
% in general. 
%
% ANOVA table (a):
% Rows: [Due to regression (explained)],[Due to error (residual)],[Total]
% Columns: [dof],[Sum of Squares],[Mean Squares],[F],[p-Value]
