# My Notes on 'Linear Algebra, Signal Processing, and Wavelets - A Unified Approach'

## Introduction
These notes are from example problems and excersizes 
in the text.
To use the files properly, the code assumes that you
have been to https://github.com/oyvindry/applinalgcode
and downloaded the correct modules for the Python
version of the book.
Although I am a MATLAB geek, I am stydying the Python
version of the book in order to expand my coding 
fluency and hopefully go a little slower than usual.
